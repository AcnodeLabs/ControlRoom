Profit = People are paying you more for whatever you are doing than what you are spending to create it

duh e.g I spend 10 hrs to do a job and people are paying me as i worked for 13 hrs (if time is money)
profit is my cost of living then profit is what i get over and above my cost of living

I have earned 160$ for 16 hrs
What i am spending PROFIT=         125$ (160 -SUM(EXP))
16 hrs of time        => what is the value in rs of my time                                 
16 hrs of electricity (4 energy savers, 1 computer, 2 monitors) =>                                          1$ 
16 hrs of internet    (27$ per month) => 105 Rs =>                                                          1$
